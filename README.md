Automatic Feature Extraction with Autoencoder for handwritten Ottoman words

This network is specially designed for feature extraction of ocr material.
We have unlabelled data that have similar sizes with MNIST. These unlabelled data consists of words cropped from Ottoman Census Documents, AUT-PFT and SRU_PHN datasets. We have augmented cropped words in Ottoman language. The validation and test sets consists only of Ottoman cropped words.
The network is from: https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.05717
We only write decoder as extra.
